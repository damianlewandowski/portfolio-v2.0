        <p>Apart from building websites and learning new things, I enjoy exercising a lot. During summer days I spend my time jogging on the beach and riding a bike.
          Sometimes I also play basketball and workout.

        <p>
          In colder days I read horror genre stories and play video games.
          Recently I've discovered a new hobby, which is cooking and baking.
